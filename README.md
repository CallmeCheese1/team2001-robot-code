# team2001-robot-code

Welcome!

This is the public repo for Team 2001 (HERMES)'s code that we used during the 2023 competition. I decided to upload our code to a public repo to future proof it, so whoever does the programming after me has a reference to "borrow" from. If you know programming, you know that's a very loose "borrow".

The folder named "UnnamedRobotCode" is the main robot code. At the time that I made the project, I didn't know what the robot's name was. It ended up being Dionysus, but it would've been too much work to rename the folder without likely making something go wrong, and I was more focused on making something work in the first place.
